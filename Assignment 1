1-2 When I intentionally made an error syntax by typing "prin" instead of typing "print". This made the code not work. During the "Hello World" code, I made a spelling mistake on purpose and the code still went through saying "Hello worl". This is because even when there is a spelling mistake, the code will still run. When I made a spelling mistake for the "print" code, the code failed because print is a "print" is the action part of the code.

Three programs I would want to create if i had unlimited coding skills are auto trade system for trading, an auto check out system for clothes, and auto medicine search system. I have been trying to get into trading for some time, however i'm not good at predicting how the stocks will change. The trading system would help me predict the way the stock will go. The auto check out system for clothes would help me buy clothes faster. Finally, As a biology major trying to go to pharmacy school, the auto medicine search coding system would help the person by filling out their symptoms and the coding system would help them find the best medicine to help them.
